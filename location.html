            <h3>How to Get There</h3>
            <p>Ios does not have its own airport, so you’ll need to fly into <strong>Santorini International Airport (JTR)</strong> and take a ferry to Ios. Here’s how to plan your journey from the UK:</p>

            <h4>Flights from Major UK Airports to Santorini (JTR)</h4>
            <p>Based on recent information (as of February 2025), here are approximate flight options and costs from three major UK airports to Santorini. Note that flights may require a connection via Athens (ATH), and prices can vary. Check with airlines like easyJet, Ryanair, Aegean Airlines, or Skyscanner for the latest deals.</p>

            <ul>

            <h4>Ferry from Santorini to Ios</h4>
            <p>After arriving at Santorini International Airport (JTR), take a taxi or bus (~15-20 minutes) to the port in Thira (Fira). From there, catch a ferry to Ios Port, which takes approximately 45 minutes to 2 hours, depending on the ferry type (high-speed or conventional). Ferries run regularly, especially in summer, and can be booked online in advance or at the port. Popular ferry operators include Blue Star Ferries and Seajets.</p>
            <p>Once in Ios, the Cycladic Gem Luxury Villa is a short drive or taxi ride from Ios Port (about 10-15 minutes).</p>
